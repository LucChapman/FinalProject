User Manual

Note: due to some issues with background texture resizing, the game should be played in the window it is launched in and NOT IN FULLSCREEN.

Use "W", "A", "S", "D" Keys to move the player character around.
Use "F" to interact with some object or doorways.

Avoid the enemy sprites on certain levels.

The goal for the player is to flip all of the lever in each room to open the door to the next room while avoiding the enemies.
