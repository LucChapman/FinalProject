Introduction to project: This project was just about creating a small game for enjoyment, to use it, you must download the .jar file form the main branch and run it. The controls for the game are fouind in teh user manual.

Project Description: This is a solo project for CSI-2300 where I plan to build a Java based 2D video game. this video game will contian a GUI of course, it will also contian scripts for the player, their
movement, as well as scripts to complete the simple puzzle interactions that will be added for gameplay, scen changing scripts to move from a start screen to the scene where the game will take place, and finaly a basic enemy script to chase the player and cause a game over screen. This project will utilize libgdx, a library of java commands and methods for game development, as well as intelij, a place to organize the games directory and a workspace when developing the game. The assets to be used in the game will be 2D and made entirely by me, there will be no sounds however.

Estimate of Effort: This game should be completable in the 3-4 weeks I have to develop it, I will begin first by creating a basic script to move from a start menu to the game and then to a final ending screen. I will then create a player character with movement and animations, then move onto creating the game and basic puzzles to complete. Finally I will create an enemy ai and sprite to chase the player and possibly cause a game over screen on contact.

Included in the directory is a .png image of the classes I need when scripting.

After Project,
After completing the project I remade the UML diagram, it should be called FinalProjectAfter.png in this repository.
I encountered some issued when programming the game, It should be played windowed and not fullscreened because the background textures resize themselves the wrong way and I could not figure out how to fix it.
I also had some issues commiting all of the files to githib, in this main branch is the jar file and other requirements for this assignment. There is a second branch called the master branch whihc keeps the
entire folder for the project inside and everything that came with it.

I hope this helps and I hope you enjoy!
