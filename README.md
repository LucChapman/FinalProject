Project Description: This is a solo project for CSI-2300 where I plan to build a Java based 2D video game. this video game will contian a GUI of course, it will also contian scripts for the player, their
movement, as well as scripts to complete the simple puzzle interactions that will be added for gameplay, scen changing scripts to move from a start screen to the scene where the game will take place, and finaly a basic enemy script to chase the player and cause a game over screen. This project will utilize libgdx, a library of java commands and methods for game development, as well as intelij, a place to organize the games directory and a workspace when developing the game. The assets to be used in the game will be 2D and made entirely by me, there will be no sounds however.

Estimate of Effort: This game should be completable in the 3-4 weeks I have to develope it, I will begin first by creating a basic script to move from a start menu to the game and then to a final ending screen. I will then create a player character with movement and animations, then move onto creating the game and basic puzzles to complete. Finally I will create an enemy ai and sprite to chase the player and possibly cause a game over screen on contact.

Included in the directory is a .png image of the classes I need when scripting.
